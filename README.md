# BasicScriptingLanguage

This is my own scripting language based on the arithmetic syntax parser written in C++ from scratch. It takes source code as an input and executes program by checking grammatical correction. In this primitive language you can:
- initilize variables and literals
- add/subtract/multiply/divide/modulo
- use if-else stament 
- loop through while loop

The projects in the main part consists of the arithmetic calculator and operates on integeral data types saved in memory (map data structure). If you want, you can develop it to extend other features.
